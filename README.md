# IFML Compose Plugin

Android Studio plugin that provides tools to visualize and edit [IFML](https://www.ifml.org/) models based on the current project. The plugin is tailored for building Android applications using the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/documentation) framework.

The user experience comprises automatic code generation through model diagram operations, as well as synchronized, parallel visualization of both diagrams and source code.

The plugin is meant to ease Android user interface development by allowing programmers to generate or modify interface components directly through diagrams, and then customize them from the source code.
